# Fourier_Series
Calculate the complex coefficients of the Fourier series function and plot it.
Open the Fourier_Series.m first! Then By defining the function in the specified section and entering the period value of the function and the maximum Nâ€Œ, you can see the function diagram and the complex coefficients of the Fourier series.
